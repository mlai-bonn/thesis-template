\chapter{Setup}

The \texttt{mlai-thesis} class is intended to aid you in fulfilling 

\section{Structure and Requirements} 

This thesis template includes the following files 

\begin{description}[font=\normalfont\ttfamily]
	\item[mlai-thesis.cls] This is the thesis document class to be used for 
	bachelor's and master's theses in the MLAI working group. The file is based 
	on the default \LaTeX \texttt{book} class and  
	\begin{itemize}
		\item defines the basic page layout (i.e., page dimensions, text 
		margins, font size and family, etc.), 
		\item redefines the \verb|\maketitle| command for a 
		proper title page layout, 
		\item provides an \texttt{abstract} environment, and 
		\item defines a default set of theorem-like environments (see, Section~\ref{sec:theorem-like-environments}). 
	\end{itemize}
	Since this file defines the most basic layout of theses, you should only make changes to it in consultation with your supervisor(s). 
	\item[thesis.tex] This is the root file of this demo document. It 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item sets the document class to \texttt{mlai-thesis},
		\item defines title, author, examiners, etc. (see Section~\ref{sec:title-page}), and 
		\item includes other files such as the \texttt{preamble.tex} and the chapter files.\VerbatimFootnotes\footnote{ Note the difference between \verb|\input| and \verb|\include|}
	\end{itemize}
	\item[preamble.tex] This file provides useful packages, commands, and default settings. Note that these packages and settings are carefully chosen so that the overall appearance of the thesis is consistent and appealing. However, the specifics of your workflow and problem setting may require different settings. Feel free to customize this file. For instance, the \texttt{preamble.tex} loads the \texttt{biblatex} package with \texttt{biber} as a citation backend\footnote{If you use a \LaTeX{} editor such as TeXstudio, it is recommended to configure the bibliography command accordingly}. If you are accustomed to the \texttt{bibtex8} backend or to \texttt{natbib}, you can change the file to load those settings. 
	\item[setup.tex] This file contains the content of this chapter which is intended to be a manual on how to use the \texttt{mlai-thesis} class. When using this template, you may want to delete this file and remove the corresponding include statement in \texttt{thesis.tex}. 
	\item[feature-reel.tex] This file contains a selection of the \texttt{mlai-thesis} templates' features. This includes a demonstration of 
	\begin{itemize} 
		\item floating environments (e.g., figures, tables, algorithms, etc.) 
		\item theorem-like environments (e.g., definitions, theorems, proofs, etc.) 
		\item lists
		\item citations 
	\end{itemize}
	\item[gfx/*] This folder is intended to contain included graphics. By default, it contains the University Bonn logo and the MLAI lab logo for the title page. You should place you image files there. 
	\item[authorship-*.tex] Every thesis must contain a statement of authorship, i.e., a declaration that you are the sole author of your thesis and indicated all other sources according to scientific standards. There is a German and an English version provided. 
\end{description}

Furthermore, the template includes skeleton files following the usual structure 
of a bachelor's or master's thesis: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item \texttt{introduction.tex}
	\item \texttt{related-work.tex}
	\item \texttt{preliminaries.tex}
	\item \texttt{conclusions.tex}
	\item \texttt{references.bib}
\end{itemize}
For a description of these sections and chapters and a rough guide on how to write them refer to the MLAI student's guide.\footnote{If you don't have it yet, ask your supervisor} %TODO: add citation to the student guide? 

% LaTeX compilers 
The template was mainly tested with \LuaLaTeX{} but, in principle, it should also work with {pdf\LaTeX{}} and \XeLaTeX{}. When a \texttt{mlai-thesis} is compiled with pdf\LaTeX{}, the following packages are loaded: \texttt{inputenc}, \texttt{fontenc}, \texttt{tgpagella}. When it is compiled with \LuaLaTeX{} or \XeLaTeX{}, the \texttt{fontspec} package is loaded instead. In all cases, the source files are expected to be encoded with UTF-8. 

\section{Class Options} \label{sec:class-options}

Some settings are automatically set depending on some class options. The following command at the beginning of the root file sets up a bachelor's thesis without the MLAI logo:  
\begin{Verbatim}
\documentclass[ba,nologo]{mlai-thesis} 
\end{Verbatim}

The following class options are available: 
\begin{description}[font=\normalfont\ttfamily]
	\item[ba] Indicate that this is a bachelor's thesis; cannot be used with \texttt{ma} 
	\item[ma] \emph{Default.} Indicate that this is a master's thesis; cannot be used with \texttt{ba} 
	\item[nologo] Hide the MLAI logo on the title page
	\item[logo] \emph{Default.} Show the MLAI logo on the title page
\end{description}
Notice that the \texttt{ba} and \texttt{ma} options use the \verb|\thesistype| command to set a placeholder on the title page. You can set this placeholder manually using the same command in the preamble or before calling \texttt{maketitle}. 

\section{Language} \label{sec:language} 

Some automatically set elements of the template, such as the line \enquote{written and submitted by} on the title page, need to be translated when you write your bachelor's thesis in German.\footnote{Master's theses are required to be written in English} Therefore, you should properly configure the thesis language. You can do so by (un)commenting the respective lines in the default \texttt{preamble.tex} file or by adding 
\begin{Verbatim}
\usepackage[ngerman]{babel}
\end{Verbatim} 
for pdf\LaTeX{} or 
\begin{Verbatim}
\usepackage{polyglossia}
\setmainlanguage{german} 
\end{Verbatim}
for \LuaLaTeX{} or \XeLaTeX{}. Notice that you cannot use \texttt{polyglossia} in conjunction with pdf\LaTeX{}. 

\section{Title Page} \label{sec:title-page} 

The title page should contain the following information: 
\begin{itemize} 
	\item the title of your thesis
	\item the author's name, i.e., your name
	\item the date of submission 
	\item the examiners noted on the registration form
	\item the supervisor(s) if different from the examiners 
	\item \emph{Optional:} the logo of the university and the MLAI logo 
\end{itemize}
For more information on the elements of the title page and the general structure of a thesis refer to the MLAI student's guide. %TODO: citation to the MLAI student's guide 

The \verb|\maketitle| command automatically generates an appropriate title page when the required information are set in the preamble or directly after \verb|\begin{document}|. 

As usual, the title is specified using the \verb|\title| command. The author's name can be specified using the \verb|\author| command. Notice that multiple authors are separated by \verb|\and|. Each author can have an additional line with date of birth and place of birth using the \verb|\birthinfo| command after a line break (\verb|\\|). \textbf{Important:} If you write your thesis in a group of multiple authors, each author must sign the statement of authorship and it must be unambiguously indicated which author wrote which section of the thesis. In this case, you should adapt the template to your needs. 

The examiners are set using \verb|\examiner|. They are also separated by \verb|\and|. The examiners' affiliations can be set after a line break. The supervisors are given in exactly the same way except using the \verb|\supervisor| command. 

The date of submission can be set using \verb|\date| as is common with the \texttt{book} class.
